# ZylannUpgradeProject
 Just a 4.3 upgrade to Zylann's Voxel project...
 I made this because I wanted to use, it...however,
 when I opened it up, I was met with error after
 error. So, what I did was rewrite parts of the code
 in order to get it up and running. If there is ANY
 issue, feel free to let me know!
 
 STEPS:
 1. Go to CODE (green button) and install ZIP.
 2. Make a new Godot project.
 3. Import ALL files into the project.
 4. Enjoy.
